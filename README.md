# Hero
💡Inspiration💡
We were inspired to create KnightHope after realizing that there's a lot a person can add value to their community simply by helping people with donating items. This not only enhances the lives of others but also familiarises them with their community. Helping the community in whatever way allows an individual to grow as a person and have a deeper understanding of how they fit into the world around them.

❓What it does❓
We have donations sections where people can donate food and eradicate hunger, and donate money and clothes. We also provide a campaign page to get users updated with the level they are in, in terms of their donations. We also have a Wall of Heroes page to show all the SuperHeroes who contributed the most within the timeline provided. In addition, we provide subscriptions, People's reviews, and Contact Us sections for smoother communication.

🏗️How we built it🏗️
We Use HTML/CSS/JS for building the dashboard.
We Use Twilio for Multi-factor Authentication and Connecting SMS to use for Updates with Knights.
We use Google Calendar for Tracking progress in Campaigns and Google Cloud for deployment.
We Use Google Payment and other payment methods for users to donate the amount they want.

🚧Challenges we ran into🚧
We had a problem coming up with the features that are to be integrated into the website to come up with a minimum viable product. Also, We ran into problems with the codes and had to debug them.

🏅🏆ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE ARE PROUD OF🏅🏆
We are happy to have devised a solution to a critical problem that affects such a vast number of people with no available methods or resources to assist them. We learned a lot while working on the project not just technically but also in time management. We are proud we could complete the project and deliver a beautiful fully functional Hack this weekend.

📚🙋‍♂️What we learned📚🙋‍♂️
We learned a lot about how social well-being can be maintained among ourselves simply by adding value to each other's life, which can impact a lot of people involved.
